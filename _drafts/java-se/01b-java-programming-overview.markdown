## What is Java Programming Language?

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. 

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. 

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

Developers or users that like to learn Java programming should install Java Development Kit (JDK) on local machine. Is Java free to download? Yes, Java is free to download for personal use and for development. developers can find all the development kits and other useful tools at [www.oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/javadownload/).
