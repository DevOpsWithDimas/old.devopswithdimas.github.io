## Java Platforms / Editions?

There are four platforms of the Java programming language:

1. Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)
2. Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
3. Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)
4. JavaFX

All Java platforms consist of a Java Virtual Machine (VM) and an application programming interface (API). The Java Virtual Machine is a program, for a particular hardware and software platform, that runs Java technology applications. An API is a collection of software components that you can use to create other software components or applications. Each Java platform provides a virtual machine and an API, and this allows applications written for that platform to run on any compatible system with all the advantages of the Java programming language: platform-independence, power, stability, ease-of-development, and security.
